# Unity Code Challenge (Back-End Edition)

This is the code challenge for candidates of Team Unity. It is intended to be
completed using Visual Studio 2015 or 2017. You can download Visual Studio
here: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/.  

The project includes the infrastructure to run a .NET Web API. Do not 
delete or alter any of the existing files. Use the built-in IIS Express 
Web Server to run the project (via F5). Use the tool of your choice to 
test your api endpoints (Any browser, Postman, curl, etc.).
